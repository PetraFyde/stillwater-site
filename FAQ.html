<section>
  <h2>Is this therapy?</h2>
  <p>
    No. NeuroRegulation Hypnotherapy is not psychotherapy and does not diagnose or treat mental illness.
    It is a non-medical service focused on nervous system regulation and symptom reduction.
  </p>

  <h2>Do you take insurance?</h2>
  <p>
    Services are private pay and not billed to insurance.
  </p>

  <h2>What payment options are available?</h2>
  <p>
    Services may be paid in full or through a short-term structured payment plan.
    For payment plans, 40% is required at booking,
    with the remaining balance automatically processed over eight weeks.
  </p>

  <h2>What happens if a payment fails?</h2>
  <p>
    Missed or failed payments pause services until resolved.
    All payment plans require a valid payment method on file.
  </p>

  <h2>Is hypnotherapy safe?</h2>
  <p>
    Hypnotherapy is a guided, focused state of attention.
    Clients remain aware and in control throughout the session.
  </p>

  <h2>Can this be used alongside medical care?</h2>
  <p>
    Yes. This work may be used alongside medical or mental health treatment,
    but it does not replace professional medical care.
