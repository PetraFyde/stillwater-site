  <h2>What a Session Is Like</h2>
  <p>
    Sessions begin with a brief conversation to understand what you are experiencing and what support
    would feel most helpful in the moment. From there, hypnosis is used as a guided, focused state of
    attention to support calming, grounding, and emotional regulation.
  </p>
  <p>
    You remain aware, able to speak, and fully in control throughout the session. This work is not about
    reliving trauma or forcing insight, but about creating a sense of safety so the nervous system can
    settle naturally.
  </p>

    The work at Stillwater Hypnotherapy is grounded in clinical hypnotherapy and nervous system regulation.
    Sessions are collaborative, consent-based, and paced according to individual needs.
