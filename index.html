      <p>
        When emotions spike or everything feels unsteady, the nervous system needs support before solutions.
        Stillwater Hypnotherapy offers a grounded, respectful space to settle, stabilize, and regain a sense
        of internal safety.

      <h2>Acute Emotional Relief Session</h2>
      <p class="price">$95</p>
      <p>
        A focused hypnotherapy session designed to reduce emotional overwhelm, calm the nervous system,
        and help you feel more present and regulated. This session is ideal during periods of shock,
        anxiety, grief, or sudden life disruption.
      </p>
      <p>
        Sessions are gentle, collaborative, and trauma-informed. You remain aware and in control at all times.
      </p>

<section class="process">
  <h2>What a Session Is Like</h2>
  <p>
    Sessions begin with a brief conversation to understand what you are experiencing and what support
    would feel most helpful in the moment. From there, hypnosis is used as a guided, focused state of
    attention to support calming, grounding, and emotional regulation.
  </p>
  <p>
    You remain aware, able to speak, and fully in control throughout the session. This work is not about
    reliving trauma or forcing insight, but about creating a sense of safety so the nervous system can
    settle naturally.

  <h2>About the Approach</h2>
  <p>
    The work at Stillwater Hypnotherapy is grounded in clinical hypnotherapy and nervous system regulation.
    Sessions are collaborative, consent-based, and paced according to individual needs.
  </p>
  <p>
    The focus is not on performance or suggestion, but on helping the mind and body find steadiness during
    times of emotional intensity. Hypnosis is used as a supportive tool, not a directive one.
