  <h1>NeuroRegulation Hypnotherapy</h1>
  <p>
    Clinical hypnotherapy focused on nervous system regulation for tinnitus,
    relational stress, and emotional dysregulation.
  </p>
</header>

<section>
  <h2>What This Work Addresses</h2>
  <p>
    NeuroRegulation Hypnotherapy focuses on calming and retraining the nervous system’s threat response.
    When the nervous system remains in a prolonged state of alert, symptoms persist rather than resolve.
  </p>
  <p>
    This approach is particularly effective for conditions driven by hypervigilance,
    stress reactivity, and persistent nervous system activation.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Tinnitus and sound sensitivity</li>
    <li>Emotional distress following relationship loss</li>
    <li>Attachment-related anxiety and emotional fixation</li>
    <li>Stress-related sleep disruption</li>
    <li>Chronic nervous system overactivation</li>
  </ul>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Tinnitus & Nervous System Regulation</h2>
  <p>
    Tinnitus is strongly influenced by nervous system arousal.
    When the brain remains in a threat-monitoring state,
    sound perception becomes amplified and difficult to ignore.
  </p>
  <p>
    NeuroRegulation Hypnotherapy supports tinnitus habituation by reducing autonomic arousal
    and interrupting the feedback loop between stress and sound awareness.
  </p>
  <p>
    This work does not promise to eliminate sound.
    The goal is to reduce distress, reactivity, and the intrusive quality of tinnitus
    so it no longer dominates attention or daily life.
  </p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Relational Stress & Emotional Dysregulation</h2>
  <p>
    Relationship loss can destabilize the nervous system,
    especially when attachment bonds are disrupted suddenly or without closure.
    This often results in emotional looping, intrusive thoughts, anxiety,
    and difficulty moving forward.
  </p>
  <p>
    NeuroRegulation Hypnotherapy addresses the physiological stress response underlying these symptoms.
    Sessions focus on emotional stabilization, attachment deactivation,
    and restoring internal regulation.
  </p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>What Sessions Are Like</h2>
  <p>
    Sessions are structured, individualized, and goal-focused.
    We begin by identifying how your nervous system is responding
    and where regulation has become disrupted.
  </p>
  <p>
    Hypnotherapy is used as an active process to support nervous system recalibration.
    This work is practical and contained.
    It is not talk therapy and does not require emotional reliving.
