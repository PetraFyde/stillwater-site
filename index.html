    <h1>NeuroRegulation Hypnotherapy</h1>
    <p>
      Clinical hypnotherapy focused on nervous system regulation for relationship loss,
      chronic stress, and tinnitus-related reactivity.

    <section id="intro">
      <h2>Regulating the Nervous System After Prolonged Stress</h2>
      <p>
        NeuroRegulation Hypnotherapy works at the level of the nervous system rather than
        treating symptoms in isolation. This approach supports individuals whose systems
        have become locked in heightened alert, emotional overwhelm, or sensory reactivity
        following prolonged stress or loss.

    <section id="scope">
      <h2>Who This Work Is For</h2>
      <p>
        NeuroRegulation Hypnotherapy supports nervous system regulation in cases of:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Relationship loss and attachment-related stress</li>
        <li>Tinnitus and sensory reactivity</li>
        <li>Chronic stress and hyperarousal states</li>
        <li>Sleep disruption linked to nervous system activation</li>
        <li>Sensory sensitivity and ongoing hypervigilance</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section id="why-both">
      <h2>Why Relationship Loss and Tinnitus?</h2>
      <p>
        Although relationship loss and tinnitus may appear unrelated, both are driven by
        the same underlying nervous system processes. In each case, the brain becomes locked
        in a heightened threat and vigilance state, leading to emotional distress, sensory
        amplification, and difficulty settling. NeuroRegulation Hypnotherapy focuses on
        stabilizing these core response patterns rather than treating symptoms in isolation.
        By working at the level of nervous system regulation, this approach can support
        recovery across different presentations that share the same biological mechanisms.

        current symptoms, and determining whether a structured NeuroRegulation program
        is appropriate. This session is not hypnosis and does not obligate you to enroll.
