        <h2>Regulating the Nervous System After Prolonged Stress</h2>
        <p>
          NeuroRegulation Hypnotherapy works at the level of the nervous system rather than
          treating symptoms in isolation. This approach supports individuals whose systems
          have become locked in heightened alert, emotional overwhelm, or sensory reactivity
          following prolonged stress or loss.

        <h2>Who This Work Is For</h2>
        <p>
          NeuroRegulation Hypnotherapy supports nervous system regulation in cases involving:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Relationship loss and attachment-related stress</li>
          <li>Tinnitus and sensory reactivity</li>
          <li>Chronic stress and hyperarousal states</li>
          <li>Sleep disruption linked to nervous system activation</li>
          <li>Sensory sensitivity and ongoing hypervigilance</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Why Relationship Loss and Tinnitus?</h2>
        <p>
          Although relationship loss and tinnitus may appear unrelated, both are driven by
          the same underlying nervous system processes. In each case, the brain becomes locked
          in a heightened threat and vigilance state, leading to emotional distress, sensory
          amplification, and difficulty settling.
        </p>
        <p>
          NeuroRegulation Hypnotherapy focuses on stabilizing these core response patterns
          rather than treating symptoms in isolation. By working at the level of nervous
          system regulation, this approach can support recovery across different
          presentations that share the same biological mechanisms.
